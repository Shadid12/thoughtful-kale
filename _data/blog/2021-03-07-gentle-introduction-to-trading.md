Hey everyone!

Glad you could check out my blog.  I started this because I am so interested and fascinated with everything going on in the market.  If you’ve been following the news there has been a spike in trading app downloads and people opening accounts for the first time.  This is great, this means that people are thinking about how to invest their money and not just have it laying around!

Ok. So if you’re like me you probably opened up your trading app account this past year. So like me, you might be asking yourself, now what?

Lol, this whole market stuff has a learning curve, but I promise it is rewarding in the long term! Once you start learning basic things like looking up company tickers on google you discover this whole other side of the interwebs.

I’ll tell you a bit about my journey so far.  I opened up my account last year and had $2K that I was comfortable starting off with. Before investing I created a few rules for myself because I think it’s important to have a set of guidelines for yourself so you don't lose your hard-earned money! I know there are others that list rules etc., and that's great, I prefer to learn and come up with rules for myself, based on my circumstance because everyone’s situation is different. 

So I’ll jump into the rules I follow first.

- Before investing make sure the money you’re investing is money that, if lost, will not put you out on the street, keep you from eating a meal and keep you from paying your debts. For some financial advice, I read and followed “Dave Ramsey”, you can look him up in the interwebs (I am in no way promoting him and I do not get paid by this author; I do like his financial advice).

- Ok. Now that you have figured out your finances and how much money you’ll start off with, it's time to research which broker, trading app, or bank you’re going to open a trading account with (depending on where you live e.g. if you live in Canada use WealthSimple).

- Alright, so you now have your trading account. Congratulations! Now let's get into how to start investing. So our third rule is DD (Due Diligence). Always do your research on the companies you’re going to purchase. This leads me to another point that you should ask yourself. Are you a short-term investor or a long-term investor? Well, I would encourage you to become a long-term investor as it’s safer and much less stress comes from this. But in the end, you’ll decide what you prefer and that's ok! 

Alright, that's it for today, I hope this was helpful if you’re just getting started.
